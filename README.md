# Structural variation analysis on Eurasian perch
Genome analyses of archival fish samples to understand thermal adaptation by studying structural variations between different perch populations.

Bowtie_parallell.sh - script for genome alignment using Bowtie2

DNA_script.sh - script for DNA contamination on the bone and spina samples

manta.sh - script for structural variation analysis using Manta

visualization_cold_old_vs_cold_new.R - script for visualizing depth of coverage against position in the MHC gene complex in chromosome 1 for a comparison between unheated historical and unheated modern samples.
